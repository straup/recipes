        dc:title "Roast Leg of Lamb With Anchovy, Garlic and Rosemary";

        e:ingredients (
                [a:content """
1 4-pound bone-in leg of lamb

4 large garlic cloves, peeled and sliced lengthwise into thirds

20 anchovy fillets in oil, drained

1 bunch rosemary

6 tablespoons butter, softened

Freshly ground black pepper

1 2/3 cups white wine

Juice of 1 lemon

1 small bunch of watercress, to garnish (optional)

Salt, as needed"""
        ]);

        e:directions (
        [ a:content """Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. With a small, sharp
knife, make 12 incisions 2 inches deep into the fleshy side of the leg. Insert a
piece of garlic, half an anchovy and a small sprig of rosemary into each
incision. Push them in with your little finger. 

Cream the butter with the remaining anchovies and smear it all over the
meat. Sprinkle the meat generously with black pepper, place in a roasting pan
and pour the wine around it. Tuck in any leftover sprigs of rosemary and pour
the lemon juice over the meat.

Roast in the oven for 15 minutes; lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees and
roast for 1 hour more, basting from time to time with the juices. (Cook slightly
longer, depending on how well done you like your meat.) Let rest in a warm place
for at least 15 minutes before carving. 

Meanwhile, taste the juices, adding salt as needed. (It should not need much
because of the anchovies.) If the gravy is too thin, simmer it in a skillet to
thicken. If you choose, garnish the slices of lamb with sprigs of
watercress. Serve with gravy and mashed potatoes or creamed eggplant."""
