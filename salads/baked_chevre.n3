  e:directions (
    [a:content """Spoon 1/4 cup of the olive oil into a smal bowl. Spoon the breadcrumbs into another bowl.

Cut the cheese into six rounds about 3/4 inch thick. Soak the cheese rounds in the
olive oil to coat thoroughly and then roll in the bread crumbs to cover thickly.

Place the cheese rounds on a cookie sheet and refrigerate for an hour.

Remove stems from the spinach and watercress and slice the leaves into thin shreds.
Refridgerate in a bowl.

Prepare the garnish: thinly slice the sun-dried tomatoes or finely dice the red
pepper and reserve.

Just before serving, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake the breaded rounds of
cheese until brown and beginning to soften (about 5-8 minutes).

While the cheese is baking, mix the remaining olive oil with the vinegar, garlic,
mustard, and pepper until smooth. Divide the greens on six salad plates, pour dressing on
the greens, and toss.

As soon as the cheese is finished is finished baking, place a round of cheese on each
bed of greens and sprinkle the desired garnish on top. Serve at once.""";]
