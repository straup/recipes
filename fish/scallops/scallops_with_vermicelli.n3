parsley and let scallops marinate at room temperature for 45 minutes.

In a heavy saucepan cook the onion and garlic in the oil and 1 Tbs. of the butter over
moderately low heat, stirring until the onion is softened, add the oregano, thyme, basil
and chopped tomatoes and simmer the sauce, covered, stirring occasionally for 30 minues.

In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the vermicelli for 7-9 minutes, or until it is
al dente.

While the pasta is cooking, in a large heavy skillet heat the remaining 1 Tbsp. butter
over moderately high heat until it is hot, add the scallops, drained well, and saute
them, stirring for 1 minutes.

sauce to the desired consistency, the pepper and the salt to taste.Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring, and remove the skillet from heat.Drain the vermicelli and toass it with the scallop mixture.""";]
