  e:directions (
    [a:content """In a large heavy kettle, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions, leeks and
garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are very soft and deeply
browned, about 1 hour. (Lower the heat if the onions begin to stick to the bottom of the pan
or burn.)

Add the veal stock to the kettle. Wrap the thyme, parsley and bay leaf in a small square
of cheesecloth and add the bundle to the kettle. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer and
simmer 15 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in the sherry and season to taste with salt and pepper.

When ready to serve, preheat the oven to 400 F. Place a slice of toasted bread in the
bottom of 6 ovenproof soup bowls. Ladle 1 cup of soup over each. Sprinkle generously with
cheese and bake until the cheese is deepyl browned and bubbling, about 10 minutes.Allow to cool slightly and serve.""";]
