  e:directions (
    [a:content """Start by making stock. Put the water in a very large pot under high heat. When
it nears boiling, turn the heat down — you want the stock to simmer, not
boil. That means there should be convections visible in the stock, but barely a
bubble.

Remove most of the skin and fat from the chicken pieces. Leave a bit, but you
don’t need much. Score the meat with a sharp knife, five or six deep slashes per
piece. Drop the chicken pieces into the simmering water.

Toss the two quartered onions, four smashed garlic cloves, chunked celery,
peppercorns, and bay leaves into the stock, along with two teaspoons of
salt. Simmer for about 45 minutes.

After about 45 minutes, pull the chicken pieces out of the stock with tongs and
put them in a bowl. Let them cool for a few minutes, then use a sharp knife to
pull the meat off the bones. You don’t have to be very precise; plenty of meat
will come off easily — you don’t have to fight for every scrap of it. Chop the
meat coarsely, cover it, and set aside (ideally in the fridge). Put the
de-meated (but still a bit meaty) bones back in the stock to simmer some more.

Now get started on the soup. Heat another large pot and add the olive oil, then
the rest of the onions, celery, and carrots. Stir the vegetables under medium
heat for about five or six minutes until the onions turn translucent.

Add the minced garlic and cook for another two minutes.

Add the turmeric and stir for a minute to warm it up. Then ladle, through a
strainer, about a litre of the stock from the stock pot into the soup pot.

Add the dry herbs, and cook at a very low boil for 15 or 20 minutes. By now the
stock will have been simmering for almost 90 minutes. Turn the heat off the
stock.

Add the reserved chicken meat to the soup pot, and ladle the rest of the stock
(through a strainer) into the soup, reserving about a litre* in a separate
container.

Add the fresh parsley and simmer the soup for another 10 minutes, then add the
noodles. Simmer for five minutes to soften the noodles.

  e:notes (
    [a:content """The herb quantities are approximate — I never measure. You can use fresh herbs
if you have them. Just triple the amount and add them later in the process.
"""] 

    [a:content """This makes a lot of soup: about eight servings. If you plan to store some in the
fridge for later consumption, be aware that the noodles will continue to swell,
absorbing more liquid. The next day, the soup will look almost like a noodle
casserole. *That’s why I suggest you set aside a litre of stock: when you warm
up the leftovers, you can “re-soupify” it by adding the stock. The photo above
is of day-2 leftovers, "re-soupified."

On the other hand, you could take this alternative approach: instead of adding
the noodles to the whole pot of soup, set aside the amount you expect to store
for later. Then, add enough noodles to the remaining soup for the day’s
meal. Next day, when you warm up the leftovers, add the rest of the noodles then
and cook for five minutes (or however long it takes for the noodles you're
using). Personally, I think that's too much work!
