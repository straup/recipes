  e:directions (
    [a:content """Put oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, and turn heat to medium-high. A
minute later, add as many chicken pieces as will fit without crowding, skin side down.
Cook, rotating pieces and adjusting heat as necessary to cook them evenly, until nicely
browned on skin side, about 5 minutes; turn and brown on other sides. As pieces are done,
sprinkle them with salt and pepper, transfer them to a large casserole, and add
remaining pieces. The entire process will take about 15 minutes.

When chicken is all browned, add onions to fat remaining in skillet; cook over
medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes, then transfer
them to casserole. Add salt pork or bacon to skillet, if you are using one of them, and cook,
stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp, about 5 minutes; transfer to
casserole and drain all but 1 tablespoon of fat. Turn heat to medium, add garlic and, 30 seconds
later, the prunes. Cook for a minute, stirring once or twice, then add to casserole.

Turn heat under skillet to high and add half the wine. Cook, stirring and scraping
bottom of pan to remove any solid particles there, until wine is reduced by half. Pour into
casserole along with remaining wine. Turn heat under casserole to high and bring to a
boil; stir, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer, stirring once or twice, until
chicken is done, about 30 minutes. Remove top, stir in optional butter, if using, and
raise heat to high; cook until sauce thickens a bit. Taste and adjust seasoning if
necessary. Garnish with parsley and serve.""";]

  e:notes (
    [a:content """The standard coq au vin, even when it is made with shortcuts, is a hearty dish, what
with its bacon, garlic, deep red wine and enrichment of butter. But the one I like best is
made with prunes: it's darker, richer, fuller, the kind of recipe one adores and makes repeatedly.Generally speaking, poultry (or any meat) cooked with dried fruit works well.
Because dried fruit has more concentrated levels of acidity and flavor and less water than
fresh fruit, it usually combines better with savory foods.In this instance, the prunes melt into the wine and become barely recognizable,
bringing even more depth, not only of color but of flavor. Despite its relative ease of
preparation, this becomes a serious dish, the kind that demands plenty of bread so that you
can linger over the juices.None of this can happen without at least a little bit of effort. The chicken must be
well- browned before proceeding with the dish, and in this instance there is no hurrying
the process: take your time, brown each piece of chicken well, secure in the knowledge
that the rest of the dish is dead easy and that you'll thank yourself at the table. When
you finish browning the chicken, you soften some chopped onions in the remaining fat,
then brown some bacon or salt pork, followed by garlic and prunes. Finally, you deglaze
the remaining bits of all of those ingredients with red wine before simmering the
chicken in the mixture and finishing with a little butter.I've made both the bacon and the butter optional in the recipe below and, indeed, the
dish still merits all the adjectives used above without either of them. But the amount
of each is probably insignificant from a health perspective when divided by four, and
the smokiness contributed by the bacon and richness added by the butter are both
noticeable and luxurious. Should you choose not to use the bacon, you might soak a half-ounce
of porporcini mushrooms those from Chile, which are often dried over wood and
therefore as smoky as bacon, are a good choice -- in a cup of hot water, then add them and the water
to the skillet along with the wine (reduce the amount of wine by a half cup). This
results in an equally delicious dish.There are other possible variations: sauti a cup or so of sliced button (white)
mushrooms in the skillet, either instead of the bacon or after it. Similarly, you can brown a
dozen or so peeled pearl onions at that stage, with or without the mushrooms (don't,
however, omit the chopped onions), or a dozen or more whole cloves of garlic.""";
