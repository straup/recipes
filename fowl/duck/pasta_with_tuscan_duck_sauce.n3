    [a:content """Trim visible fat from duck legs, then lay them, skin side down, in a 10-inch skillet.
Turn heat to medium; when duck begins to sizzle, turn heat to low and cover. Cook
undisturbed about an hour (check once to be sure legs aren't burning); the skin should be
golden brown. Turn and cook until duck is very tender, at least 30 minutes.

Remove duck and set aside. Add onion to skillet and turn heat to medium-high. Cook,
stirring occasionally, until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Set a large pot of salted
water to boil for the pasta.

Add wine to skillet and raise heat to high; cook until liquid is reduced by about half.
Add tomatoes and some salt and pepper, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring
occasionally, until mixture is saucy, about 15 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Meanwhile, shred duck from bone and add it to sauce as it cooks. A few minutes after
adding tomatoes, cook pasta. When it is tender but not mushy, drain it and serve it with
sauce, along with cheese.""";]
