  e:directions (
    [a:content """Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Rinse the veal bones and pat them dry; toss the bones with the oil.

In a deep roasting pain, add the veal bones and roast, turning occasionally, until
the bones begin to brown, about 30 minutes.

Add the onions, carrots, celery and garlic to the pan, toss well and continue to
roast, turning occasionally, until deeply browned, about 40 minutes more.

Using tongs, transfer the bones and vegetables to a large stockpot and add the veal
meat. Pour off and discard any excess oil from the roasting pan and place the pan over
medium heat.

When hot, pour in 1 1/2 cups water, scrape up any brown drippings from the bottom of the
pan and add the mixture to the stockpot.

Wrap the cloves, thyme, bay leaf, parsley and peppercorns in a small square of
cheesecloth and add the bundle to the stockpot. Add 6 quarts (24 cups) cold water.

Over medium heat, slowly bring the stock to a simmer; this will take about 45 minutes.
Skim off any fat from or foam that rises to the surface. Continue to simmer the stock
slowly, uncovered, for 6 hours, skimming as needed.

Strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the solids.To cool, pour the stock into a large kettle and place the kettle in a sink filled with
cold water. Stir the stock occasionally. If the water in the sink becomes too warm, drain
and refill with cold water.When the stock is completely cooled, pour into individual containers, cover them
and refrigerate for atleast 24 hours. Before using, remove and discard the layer of
congealed fat.Stock will keep refrigerated up to 3 days and frozen up to 6 months.""";]
