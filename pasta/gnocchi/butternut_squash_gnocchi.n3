Clean the leeks and remove the tough, green parts of the stem. Cut each leek in half
lengthwise and then slice into pieces 1/3 inch wide.

Heat a large pan over a medium heat and add the butter. Add the herbs and leeks and let
them cook until they are soft. Add the pine nuts.

Add the wine and raise the temperature slightly. Keep an eye on the sauce and
stir occassionally.The idea is to cook off most of the wine. There should be
enough liquid left over, by the time the gnocchi is cooked, to coat all the
pasta but not so much that it is swimming in the sauce. This is a good time to
start the water for the gnocchi."""

just as tasty. I would adjust the amounts according, though. A quarter of a cup of oil is

    [a:content """I was taught to make gnocchi using only the yolk of an egg, however I've grown partial
to using the whole thing. That said, I would not use the whites in this recipe since the
additional moisture will just make it even harder to work the dough.""";

tomato and onion and red-pepper sauce and this recipe.Afterwards, I walked over to Cafe Italia and called Sarah who wasn't home. I ordered
some tiny-coffee and watched the Habs lose the hockey game.Three days later, I had my wisdom teeth removed.""";
