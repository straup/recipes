    [a:content """Trim the artichokes and remove the tough outer layers. Scoop out the hairy inner
choke and slice thinly.

In an 8" skillet, saute the artichokes in the olive oil for 3 minutes over medium heat;
season with salt. Add 1/2 cup of water to the pan, cover, and cook for 10 minutes, or
until tender.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Generously oil a 10" round pizza pan and
line it with the pizza dough, pressing with your fingers so the dough extends to the
sides of the pan.

Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden and lightly crisp. Turn on the broiler.

Top the focaccia with the sauteeds artichokes, arrange the Brie over it in a sunburst
pattern, and broil for 5 minutes, or until the Brie begins to melt.Serve hot, dividing the focaccia in 4 sections as a first course or in 8 as an appetizer.""";]

  e:notes (
    [a:content """To ues an Italian cheese, opt for Taleggio or Robiola di Roccaverano instead of the
Brie. An in order to avoid burning the focaccia in the broiler after you top it with the
cheese, set the rack 10" from the heating element.""";
