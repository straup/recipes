Half a vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped

2 medium egg yolks

                [a:content """1. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. Bring a kettle full of water to a boil.

2. Warm the cream with the vanilla bean and seeds to just before boiling,
whisking to disperse the seeds. Remove from heat, cover and let infuse for 30
minutes. 

3. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt the chocolate in the milk. Beat together
the egg yolks and confectioners’ sugar in a medium bowl. Add the chocolate
mixture and the vanilla cream and blend thoroughly. Pass through a fine mesh
sieve and pour into 4 4-ounce ramekins or 6 3-ounce porcelain espresso cups. 

4. Place the ramekins in an 8-inch baking pan. Fill the pan with enough hot
water to rise halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake in the oven until
slightly puffed and spongy, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from the pan to
cool. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours. Bring back to room temperature before
serving."""]);
