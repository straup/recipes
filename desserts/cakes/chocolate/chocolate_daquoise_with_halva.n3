  e:directions (
    [a:content """For the meringue, preheat the ven to 250 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment
paper; use a marker to trace three 8-inch circles onto paper. Turn paper marked side down.

In a large bowl, sift together confectioners' sugar and cocoa powder; set aside. In
the bowl of an electric mixer, whip egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and a
tablespoon of the granulated sugar; whip until soft peaks form. With mixer running,
gradually pour in rest of granulated sugar, and whip until very stiff peaks form. Fold a
third of the egg whites into the sugar and cocoa mixture. Fold in remaining whites.

Transfer mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip or to a large resealable
plastic bag with a corner cut off. Starting just within the circles marked on
parchment paper, pipe rounds of batter, working inward in a spiral. Bake for 2 hours, then turn
off oven; allow meringues to dry in oven until oven has cooled completely, atleast 4
hours longer.

For ganache, place chocolate in a bowl. In a saucepan, bring cream to a boil. Pour it
over chocolate, and let site for 3 minutes. Starting in center, whisk well to combine.
Refridgerate, covered, until thickened but still pourable, 1 to 2 hours.

For halvah cream, pour milk into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, in a
large heatproof bowl, whisk together tahini, honey, cornstarch and egg yols. Pour a
little bit of hot milk into tahini mixture, whisking constantly. Continue to whisk, and ad
rest of milk to bowl. Pour mixture back into saucepan and bring to a boil, whisking
constantly. Boil, whisking for 2-3 minutes until very thick. Transfer to a bowl, and whisk
in half of crumbled halvah. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, and refridgerate until
chilled, atleast 1 hour.

Whip heavy cream just until it is thick enough to hold soft peaks. Gently fold cream
and the remaining crumbled halvah into chilled tahini mixture.

To assemble, set aside nicest meringue disk for top layer. Place one meringue layer
in an 8-inch springform pan. Spread half of halvah cream over meringue. Place another
round of meringue over cream. Pour ganache onto meringue in an even layer. Spread
ganache with remaining halvah cream. Top with last round of meringue. Freeze for 1-2 hours.

Before serving, run a knife around the edge of pan, then unfold dacquoise. Sift a thin
layer of powdered sugar over top. To slice, use a serrated knife dipped in hot water.
Wipe dry between cuts.""";]

  e:history (
    [a:content """Halvah, the Middle Eastern confection made from ground sesame seeds and sugar, is
one of the most interesteing sweets there is. It has a terrific earthly favor, but what I
really adore is its texture. At first it seems perfectly smooth, but as you chew a
slighlty crunch emerges. It's as if it were made up of millions of sugary, wafer-thin caramel layers.While halvah is a great candy, its intriguing texture inspired me to use it in a
dessert. But I needed to do so in a way that would highlight, rather than subdue, its aazing
crunch. Dacquoise seemed just the right vehicle.This is because dacquoise, like halvah, is as much about texture as it is about
flavour. The classic version is a layering of crisp meringue; soft ethereal mousseline
cream; and dense ganache. When I make it in the traditional style, I like to accentuate its
textural contrasts by sprinkling crushed nougatine into the cream, both to mimic the
meringue and to interrupt the silkiness of the cream. Since halvah has the same kind of
hard candy crunch as nougatine, this seemed a perfect opportunity to use it in a dessert.Halvah also adds an unusual, aromatic flavour. To play up this taste and accentuate
its Middle Eastern origins, I like to use honey in place of sugar in the thick cream, and
to add a little bit of tahini.The intensity of the halvah cream, however, needs a potent mate, which is why I chose
cocoa for the meringues. Since meringue is made up of little more than egg white, sugar
and air, it can be cloying. Cocoa powder tempers that tendency and gives the dacquoise a
slight bitterness that matches perfectly with the halvah.To maintain the crispiness of the meringue, it's important to assemble this dessert
as close to serving time as possible. Ideally, layer it together an ahour ahead, then
freeze it. This brief freezing firms up the pastry cream so that it cuts cleanly. Once
sliced, the dacquoise immediately defrosts, its marvelous textures intact.""";
