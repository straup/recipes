    [a:content """Sift together the flour and baking soda and put aside.

Sour the milk (add about a teaspoon of lemon juice or vinegar and stir until it
curdles) and put aside.

Shave the chocolate in a saucepan large enough to mix the cake in, add the butter and
hot water, and place over low heat; stir until thickened.

Remove from the flame and add sugar, salt, and egg.

Then add the sifted flour and soda alternately with the sour milk. Add vanilla. Pour
into a greased and floured 8- or 9- inch square pan (or double the recipe and use layer
cake tins).

Bake in a slow oven (325 F) for 20-25 minutes until it pulls away a little from the sides
of the pan.""";]

  e:notes (
    [a:content """The family icing is a little hard to define in precise amounts, but in an electric
mixer put softened butter (about 1/3 stick), Hershey's cocoa, Confectioners sugar,
vanilla, and light cream or milk. Turn it on and more of whatever seems right for amount,
colour, and consistency. Beat at high speed for 5 minutes at least. It should make a soft
"swirl" pattern.""";

cakes had to be identified with all their adjectives. It is a gem - is there anyone out
there who needs to be convinced?Moist, very chocolatey, and a wonderful mix for chocolaholics. The recipe has been
around for a very long time. Dottie's recipe card calls it "Bess' Chocolate Cake" - and
her Aunt Bess would be at least 125 were she living as this is written!""";
