Zabaglione With Strawberries and Balsamic Meringue
==

Ingredients
--

* 5 `eggs` *room temperature*
* 1/2 c `confectioners sugar` *sifted*
* 1 1/3 T `balsamic vinegar` *aged*
* 3/8 c `sugar`
* 1/3 c `prosecco`
* 3/8 c `heavy cream`
* 1 pt `strawberries` *rinsed, hulled and dried*

Directions
--

Heat oven to 250 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment.

Separate the egg yolks and the egg whites.

Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with salt until very foamy. Continue
beating, adding the confectioners' sugar gradually, until stiff and shiny. Beat in 1
teaspoon vinegar and the vanilla. Spread meringue about 1/2 inch thick on parchment.
Place in oven, and bake 2 hours. Turn off oven, and allow to cool in oven at least 1 hour,
until crisp. Break into bite-size pieces, and store in dry place until ready to use.

Have a large pot of simmering water one to two inches deep on stove. Pot should be able
to hold a large metal mixing bowl without the bowl's touching the water. Have a large
bowl of ice water ready.

Place the egg yolks in mixing bowl away from heat. With a large balloon whisk, beat
yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in bowl until yolks have lightened in color and start to thicken.
Place bowl on pan of simmering water, and continue beating, gradually adding prosecco,
until yolks have thickened to a custardy consistency, 10 to 15 minutes. When
zabaglione is very thick and whisk leaves a trace in bottom of bowl, place bowl in bowl of ice
water to cool. Stir once or twice, so mixture cools evenly.

Beat the cream until it just holds peaks. Refrigerate. When the zabaglione is cold,
fold in whipped cream. Refrigerate.

Sweeten the strawberries with 1/4 cup sugar, or to taste. Fold in remaining balsamic
vinegar. Divide strawberries among 4 old-fashioned glasses or goblets. Top with
crumbled meringue, then with zabaglione. Garnish with a few pieces of meringue, and serve.
