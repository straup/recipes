Earl Grey Infused Blender Chocolate Mousse
==

Ingredients
--

* 6 ounces high quality bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped (or 2/3 cup chocolate chips)
* 1/2 cup boiling water
* 1 Earl Grey tea bag
* 2 teaspoons freshly grated orange zest
* 4 teaspoons granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 large egg whites
* Lightly sweetened whipped cream, mascarpone, or greek yogurt (for topping)

Directions

Bring water to a boil. Add tea bag, orange zest, and sugar. Cover and steep for five minutes.

Place chopped chocolate and vanilla extract in blender. Strain steeped tea into blender (you want just the liquid in the blender, not the zest). Let sit about 30-60 seconds to allow the chocolate to begin to melt. Cover the blender and blend on high for 15 to 30 seconds.

Add egg whites to the blender, cover, and blend on high for about 60 seconds.

Divide mousse between 4 small serving containers. (Get creative! Think 1/2 pint mason jars, tea cups, cute bowls, etc.) Cover and refrigerate until set. This usually takes about 3 to 4 hours, but can be done up to 2 days in advance.

Top mousse with a dollop of lightly sweetened whip cream, mascarpone, or greek yogurt, and serve. I used greek yogurt with a pinch or orange zest and a splash of orange juice quite successfully, but play around with your own favorite flavorings!
