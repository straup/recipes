    [a:content """Cream the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy,
then beat in the egg tolk, almond essence, ground almonds and flour until evenly mixed.

Chill until firm, about 2 hours.

Preheat the oven the 160 degrees C (325 F). Line 3-4 baking sheets with non-stick
baking paper.

Break off small pieces of dough and roll into balls with your hands, making 40
altogether. Place the balls on the baking sheets, spacing them out as they will spread in the oven.

Bake the biscuits for 20 minutes or until golden. Remove the baking sheets from the
oven, lift off the paper with the biscuits on, then place on wire racks.

Leave the biscuits to cool on the paper. Repeat with the remaining mixture.

When the biscuits are cold, lift them off the paper. Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a
pan of hot water. Sandwitch the biscuits in pairs, with the melted chocolate. Leave to
cool before serving."""]
