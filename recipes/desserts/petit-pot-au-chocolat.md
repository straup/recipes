==

Ingredients
--

* 3/4 c `heavy cream`
* 1/2 `vanilla bean` *split lengthwise, seeds scraped*

Directions
--

Preheat the oven to **275 F**. Bring a kettle full of water to a boil.

Warm the cream with the vanilla bean and seeds to just before boiling,
whisking to disperse the seeds. Remove from heat, cover and let infuse for 30
minutes. 

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt the chocolate in the milk. Beat together
the egg yolks and confectionersâ€™ sugar in a medium bowl. Add the chocolate
mixture and the vanilla cream and blend thoroughly. Pass through a fine mesh
sieve and pour into 4 4-ounce ramekins or 6 3-ounce porcelain espresso cups. 

Place the ramekins in an 8-inch baking pan. Fill the pan with enough hot
water to rise halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake in the oven until
slightly puffed and spongy, **45 - 60 minutes**. Remove from the pan to
cool. Refrigerate for at least **6 hours**. Bring back to room temperature before
serving.
