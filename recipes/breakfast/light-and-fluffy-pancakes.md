Light and fluffy pancakes

Ingredients
--

* 2 c `flour` *all purpose*
* 1 t `baking powder`
* 1/2 t `baking soda`
* 1 t `salt` *kosher*
* 1 1/2 T `sugar`
* 2 `eggs` *large*
* 4 T `butter` *melted*
* 2 c `buttermilk`
* `butter` or `oil` *for the griddle*

Directions

Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in large bowl. Whisk
to combine. In separate bowl, whisk eggs until frothy. Slowly drizzle in butter
while whisking. Add buttermilk and whisk until homogenous.

Heat griddle or large non-stick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes. Pour wet
ingredients over dry ingredients and whisk until just combined (there should
still be plenty of lumps). Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle
and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. 

Ladle pancake batter onto griddle in four 1/4-cup portions. Cook undisturbed
until edges of pancakes begin to set and bubbles start to break the top surface,
about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes with a thin, flexible
spatula and cook on second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2
minutes longer. Serve pancakes immediately or keep warm no a wire rack set in a
rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the three remaining batches.

* Someone asked: "Can you give us the weight of flour you used?". The answer is: 
  "5 ounces per cup. Sorry, I should have included that. Total weight is 10
  ounces." Do with that information what you will...
