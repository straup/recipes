Corn, Bacon, and Clam Stew
==

Ingredients

--

* 2 tablespoons Olive oil
* 1/2 pound thick-cut bacon, cut into lardons
* 1 tablespoon sweet smoked paprika
* 6 ears corn, shucked and cut from the cobs
* Salt, to taste
* 1/2 pound sungold yellow cherry tomatoes, halved
* half of one lemon
* 3 tablespoons bourbon
* 16 littleneck clams, scrubbed well
* 8 thick slices country bread, for serving
* small handful basil leaves, torn

Directions
--

Place a large, deep heavy soup pot over medium heat. Add the oil and bacon, and cook until the fat is rendered and the lardons are browned. Stir in the paprika and cook for 30 seconds.

Add the corn, season with salt, and stir, cooking for about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and cover. Cook until the tomatoes soften, about 5 minutes.

Squeeze in the juice from the lemon and pour in the bourbon, stir, and turn off the heat. Add the clams with the mouth facing up. Turn on the heat to medium, cover the pot, and cook the until the clams open, 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, grill or toast the bread. Remove the pot from the heat, sprinkle with basil, and bring the bread and the pot -- and a trivet -- to the table for serving.
