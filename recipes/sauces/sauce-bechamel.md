Once upon a time in Las Vegas, there was a pot which was generous enough to host a liter of something. On the **slow fire** of a summer evening, Mr `butter` melted.

Once he had already lost all his composition, but not burnt, he decided to absorb a tad too large quantity of 50 g white powder `flour`. **2 minutes** of a hard battle against a wood spoon, he was already a bit darker.

Before losing all his senses, he grabbed the `milk` bottle and by tiny sip for a good **10 minutes**, he dissolved the mass in a final liquefaction.

By the end of the evening, he was thick and slightly bubblish but so smooth. His hand into the `salt` and `pepper` hair, and a slight touch of `nutmeg` on his neck, he was ready again to hit the floor of another dish.

I guess this will have to be rewritten at a point for sanity.
