Kale and Anchovy Salad
==

Ingredients
--

* small garlic clove, smashed
* 2 anchovies
* Kosher salt
* 1/2 Meyer (or regular) lemon
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/4 small red onion, very thinly sliced
* 1/4 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
* 6 cups packed dinosaur (lacinato) kale, ribs removed, and torn into smallish pieces before measuring

Directions
--


In a mortar and pestle, mash the garlic and anchovy with a pinch of salt to a paste. Blend in the juice from half a Meyer lemon. Then beat in the olive oil. It should semi-emulsify; don't worry if it doesn't.

In a small bowl, combine the onion and thyme leaves with a large pinch of salt, then rub the salt into the onions using your hands. Let sit for 10 minutes.

Put the kale in a large bowl. Add the onion and thyme. Pour in half the dressing and using your hands, mix the greens -- really get in there and work the salad; you should almost knead the greens so they break down a bit and the dressing fully coats the leaves. Taste and add more salt, lemon juice, or dressing, as needed. Let the salad sit for 15-20 minutes. Taste and adjust once more. Then spread on a platter and serve.
