Sundubu Jigae
==

This is a Korean dish. Soft tofu in Korean is called sundubu (순두부). It is used to make a thick stew called sundubu jjigae (순두부 찌개). But you may use the Tofu of your choices and the ingredients can vary. This is one of the many recipes you can create around it.

It is a quick dish to prepare around 10 minutes preparation and 20 minutes cooking. Serve with a bowl of rice on the side. You may want to drink Soju (Hangul 소주; Hanja 燒酒) with it.

### Preparation

Prepare everything in advance. There will be no time during the cooking phase. Be sure that you can close the kitchen door. The smell is strong during the first phase of the cooking. Really. Trust me on that.

* Prepare a pot of hot water
* Put the tofu block in a colander for 10 minutes before cooking to drain a bit of the water which is inside.
* Slice the green onions every 5 cm and then slice them in two along the length.
* cut the bacon in small chunks of about 4cm.
* cut the dry tofu skin in 2 cm cube.
* cut the root of enoki but keep them in one block.

### Cooking

* Heat the pot on a strong fire. Once hot, put the spoon of sesame oil in the pot.
* Put the sliced bacon in the pot and with a wood spoon, move it to make it fried. Fried, not dried.
* Add the sliced green onions and mix. Do not burn the green onions.
* Add the kimchi and mix again.
* Add the dashi and the water and mix well. It is the last time, you will be mixing things. Just put the water that it will cover everything but don't add too much water. We are not trying to challenge Cousteau.
* Add the dry skin tofu in a corner of the pot on top of the stew. Cut the Tofu block in two and put it in another corner. Put the enoki in another corner. Same for the daikon. Basically you should have a harmonious top covering the full stew with clear view of each elements, not mixed at all. They can touch each others. ^_^
* The red stew must be visible on the base of each element, but should not drown them.
* Cover. Reduce the fire, so it will softly boil for 20 minutes.
* When 10 minutes has gone. Just turn delicately the two Tofu blocks.
* 2 minutes before serving, add two eggs on top in between the other ingredients. Cover again.

### Eating

Serve the rice in individual bowls. Prepare empty bowls on the table for the stew. Have your chopsticks around (yes it implies you are trained in the art of chopstickery). Bring the pot on the table, remove the cover, and intoxicate your friends with a wonderful smell.

And as the man said… Eat. Drink. Feel good. Don't forget the soju.
