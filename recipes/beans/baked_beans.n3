  e:directions (
    [a:content """ Soak the beans overnight in cold water.

Drain the beans, cover again with water, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and
simmer until the skins burst when blown upon (20 minutes). Drain again, saving the
liquid. Put in a large casserole, preferably of pottery.

Now scald the salt pork, and scald it quickly. Drain, and with a sharp knife cut
slashes in the rind about 1 inch apart. Bury the pork in the beans so the rind just shows.

Mix the onion, salt, mustard, molasses, and sugar with 2 cups of the bean water and
bring it all to a boil.

Add more rum and pour this mixture over the beans. Add more bean water or boiling water
if necessary; beans must be covered.

Put on a good tight lid and at 300-325F for 8 hours.

Check during cooking for more bean water for boiling water usually must be added or
the beans will be too dry.

About 1 hour befire serving, dribble bacon fat over the top.""";]

  e:history (
    [a:content """Some memories are associated with a particular smell and baked beans cooking in the
oven evoke times at Moby Hill before we had heat and a Nor'easter or a threatening
hurricane drove us indoors. Oh the wonderful comforting aroma of those baked beans with rum
and molasses cooking the whole day through while the storm raged outdoors - and the
promise of a delicious hearty dinner together in front of the fireplace!""";
