Remove the bowl from the heat and let the mixture cool.

In to a bowl sift together the flour and salt.

In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat the eggs, with the sugar, on high speed for
5-10 minutes, or until the mixture is triple in volume and forms a ribbon when the
beaters are lifted.

Fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture until the batter is just combined and fold
in the chocolate mixture gently but thoroughly.

Pour the batter into the pan, smoothing the top and bake in the middle of a preheated
350 degree F. oven for 35-35 minutes, or until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering to it.

Transfer the cake to a rack, run a sharp knife around the edge and remove the side of the pan. Invert the cake onto another rack and remove the 
  paper.Reinvert the cake onto another rack and let it cool completely.
