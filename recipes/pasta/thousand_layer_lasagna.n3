  e:directions (
    [a:content """Preheat your oven to 375. Start by clearing off every flat
space in your kitchen, you are going to need and use all of it.

Make your sauce: Place the olive oil, salt, pepper flakes, and garlic in a
pan. Dial the heat up and saute for a minute or two. Add the tomatoes and slowly
bring to a simmer as well. Remove from heat, stir in the lemon zest and taste
for seasoning. Add more salt if needed. Set aside.

Fill your biggest pot full of water and bring to a boil.
Lavishly butter a deep, square baking dish. The one I use is 9x9 and 2
1/2-inches deep.

Thin out your pasta using a pasta machine. Start by cutting the big sheets into
2-inch(ish) wide ribbons. This means making 2 cuts along the sheets. This should
yield you about 12 2-foot strips. Run them through the pasta machine. I go to
the 8 setting, one shy of the very thinnest setting. The sheets should almost be
translucent. Cut the strips into manageable rectangles roughly 4-inches in
length.

Pre-cook the pasta: Fill a large bowl with cold water and a few glugs of olive
oil. Place a large flour sack or cotton dish towel across one of your
counters. Salt your pot of boiling water generously. Ok, now you are ready to
boil off your pasta. Believe it or not, you are on the home stretch. Place a
handful of the pasta rectangles into the boiling water to cook (I've found I can
get away with about 20 at a time), fish them out (I use a pasta claw) after just
15-20 seconds, don't over cook. Transfer them immediately to the cold olive-oil
water for a quick swim and cool-off. Remove from the cold water bath and place
flat and neat on the cotton towel. It is ok for them to overlap, I don't have a
problem with the sheets sticking typically. Repeat until all your pasta is
boiled.

Pull it all together. Ladle a bit of the sauce into the bottom of the prepared
baking dish. Cover the bottom with a layer of pasta sheets. Now a thin layer of
sauce, and a bit of cheese. Go for another layer of pasta, then sauce, then
pasta again, then sauce and cheese. Keep going until you've used up all the
sauce and pasta. You want to finish with a layer of pasta. Top with the last of
the sauce and the very last of the cheese so you have a nice cheesy top.

Bake until everything is melted and fragrant, 35 minutes or so. Let it sit for
10 minutes before serving, so everything has a chance to set up a bit. Dust with
parmesan and a bit of slivered basil."""]
