Stir in the onion and crushed garlic and cook until the onion is golden. Season the
mixture with salt, pepper and cayenne and transfer it to a casserole (2-quart size for one recipe).

In the same skillet saute the mushrooms in the remaining 1/2 stick of butter. Stir the
mushrooms into the casserole and add the beef bouillon, chestnuts, megnut and bay leaf.

Cover the casserole and bake in a moderately hot oven (375 F) for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or
until the meat is tender.

Stir in the cream and cook the mixture, uncovered, for 15 minutes longer. Add the
cognac and reheat the dish. Stir in the parsley.""";]
