  e:directions (
    [a:content """Put oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. A minute later, add as many
chunks of lamb as will fit without crowding (cook in batches, if necessary).

When meat browns (3 to 4 minutes) turn chunks and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.
Adjust heat so pieces brown as rapidly as possible without burning.

After each has browned on 2 sides, remove from pan and add another piece or two until
all meat has been browned (10 to 15 minutes).

When all meat has been removed from pan, turn off heat and allow the pan to cool a bit.
Turn heat back to medium and add garlic and cinnamon.

Cook for about 30 seconds, then add the wine; raise heat to high and let wine bubble
away for a minute. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for about a minute.

Return meat to pan and cover; adjust heat so mixture bubbles very gently. (If it cooks
too quickly, you may have to add a little water.)

Cook, undisturbed, until meat is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours.Taste and adjust seasoning, then serve over rice or buttered noodles, with lemon wedges."""]
