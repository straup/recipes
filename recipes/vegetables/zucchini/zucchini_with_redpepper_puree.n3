    [a:content """Preheat broiler. Broil peppers about 2 inches from the heat, turning them slightly
every few minutes, until their skin blisters on all sides and turns black, about 15-20 minutes.

Put the peppers in a plastic bag, close bag and let stand 10 minutes. Peel peppers,
remove seeds and ribs and cut each pepper into 3 or 4 pieces.

In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add peppers, thyme and
pinch of salt and pepper. Saute peppers for 1 minute on each side.

Remove mixture from skillet and puree peppers until very smooth in a food processor
or blender. Taste and adjust seasoning. (Puree can be kept, covered, 1 day in
refridgerator; reheat before continuing.)

Prepheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water, cook
zucchini for 2 minutes. Rinse under cold running water and drain thoroughly.

Cut each zucchini in half lengthwise. With a small sharp knife, carefully scoop
seeds out of each half, leaving a boat-shaped shell; be careful not to pierce the sides.

Put zucchini in an oiled shallow baking dish. Rub cut surfaces with remaining oil,
and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake 5 minutes.

Spoon pepper puree evenly into zucchini shells. Bake 10 more minutes, or until ends
of zucchini are tender when pierced with a sharp knife. Serve hot or at room temperatur
as a first course or side dish.""";]
