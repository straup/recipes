  e:directions (
    [a:content """In a large mixing-bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and
yeast. Form a well in the center. Break the eggs in a small bowl, and pour them
into the center of the well. Stir in the center of the well with a fork,
gradually mixing the flour into the eggs. Once all the flour is incorporated,
transfer the dough onto a well floured surface, and knead it for 12 minutes,
using the heel of your hand to push the dough down and away from you, before you
fold it back onto itself (this is called fraiser in French, and I have no idea
why). If the dough feels a little sticky as you do this, sprinkle a bit more
flour on the dough and your work surface, and keep kneading. 

Form a hollow in the ball of dough, put the butter into it, close the dough over
the butter, and start kneading again until the butter is completely
incorporated: at first it will feel like that will never ever happen considering
the mess you're making, but be persistent -- if it ended up working for me, it
should work for you. When you're done, the dough will be smooth and shiny and so
delightfully pleasant to handle you could keep doing that all afternoon, but
don't.

Put the ball of dough into a floured mixing-bowl, sprinkle the top with a bit
more flour, cover the bowl loosely with a kitchen towel, and let rise for two
hours in a warm spot. The dough should approximately double in volume. Grease a
tray of six muffin molds with butter. Transfer the dough onto your work surface,
punch it down a few times, and divide it into 6 equal pieces. Roll them into
balls, and plop into the muffin molds. Cover loosely with the kitchen towel, and
let rise for another hour (note: I am not entirely sure that this second rise is
necessary for instant yeast, but I did it for good luck). 

Preheat the oven to 200° C (400° F), with a small ramequin of water
inside. Brush the brioches lightly with milk (not too much or it will burn) and
sprinkle with thick grains of sugar. Put the tray of muffin molds into the oven
to bake for 15 minutes, until puffy and golden and beautiful. Transfer onto a
rack. Eat while they're still warm, or let cool to room temperature."""]
