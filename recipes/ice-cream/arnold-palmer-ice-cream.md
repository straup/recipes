The key to making ice cream is temperature - everything must start cold, be cold and say cold. So, in advance of making your ice cream, put all your ingredients nearest the cold source in your refrigerator. Also make the tea for this recipe at least a couple hours in advance. Pour boiling water into a cup with three bags of black tea, brew for ten minutes. Add 1/2 cup milk to the tea, do not remove the bags, and set aside in the refrigerator.

A couple hours later, it's time to make ice cream! Get started on the cream base: Crack two eggs into a large bowl and beat them by hand or mixer until they are fluffy. Add 1 cup sugar and continue mixing until it is incorporated. Then add 2 cups of heavy cream and your milk/tea mixture (squeeze out the teas bags to get all their flavor), and beat again.

Add the juice and zest of one lemon, as well as one bag of dried tea leaves, and give the whole thing a last whirl. Freeze the cream base according to how your ice cream maker works best. When the lemon ice cream is stiff, scoop it into a tupperware dish and set it aside in your freezer.

Serve up and garnish with lemon zest and "tea crunchies", ie those good quality crushed tea leaves. I like Darjeeling best, because it's beautiful and has a complex bitter and floral flavor combo.
