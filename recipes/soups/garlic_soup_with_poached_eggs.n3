  e:directions (
    [a:content """In a large saucepan, combine the garlic, salt, pepper,
sage, thyme, bay leaf, parsley sprigs and olive oil. Add 2 quarts of
water. Place over high heat and bring to a boil; then reduce heat to low and
simmer for 30 minutes.

Pour through a fine-meshed strainer into a heatproof bowl, pressing on the
garlic to squeeze out as much flavor into the broth as possible. Let cool and
then transfer to a covered container and refrigerate until needed.

To prepare a serving for one, ladle about 1 1/3 cups of broth into a small
saucepan. Place over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer. Carefully break an
egg into the broth (do not break the yolk) and poach until the white is just
set, about 1 ½ minutes. (It will continue to cook off the heat.) Transfer the
egg to a soup bowl and pour the broth gently over it. Garnish with parsley and
cheese. If desired, serve with crusty bread."""]

  e:history (
    [a:content """ There's a New York rule, one of those we osmose through the
soles of our stylish yet affordable boots, that on your first night in a new
apartment, you must order takeout. For my first night in a tiny studio on the
Upper East Side, which I sublet last fall after separating from my husband of
seven years, it was abysmal pizza washed down with a bottle of cheap Tempranillo
while sitting on a brightly upholstered yet somehow melancholy futon. 

Then there's another rule, this one for those of us for whom cooking provides a
precious means of sustenance in a fragmented life: the second night in a new
apartment means a home-cooked meal. So on the first morning after the first
night, under the muffling influence of a red-wine hangover, I emptied mountains
of individually wrapped plastic cutlery from the two cabinets of my small
temporary kitchen to make room for a pot, a skillet, a wineglass and a single
sharp knife. Then I headed to the Gristedes around the corner for olive oil,
salt and pepper, garlic, onions, Parmesan and eggs, along with toilet paper and
light bulbs. I took these back to my "home" — wondering if the word would ever
lose its internally enunciated quotation marks — and made garlic soup. 

Until that night, I would never have considered making garlic soup for
dinner. My husband and I had been the kind of couple who finish each other's
sentences and have the same taste in everything — who always ate together. For
us, I always cooked solid, nourishing meals, like the ones our mothers made for
our families when we were growing up: pork chops in cream sauce, brussels
sprouts, potatoes. Meat and two sides, eaten at our dining table or, more often,
on the couch while we watched DVD's, plates perched on TV trays that seemed to
wink at our placid, slightly rumpled, 50's-style domesticity. 

But I couldn't imagine cooking like that for myself, alone.

And so I learned that garlic soup with a poached egg is the ideal meal for
one. To begin with, there's nearly nothing in it. You can divide the soup into
serving sizes, and then poach one egg in a tiny pot of it every night. It's both
light and sustaining, like something the ancient Chinese would have eaten for
its medicinal qualities: garlic for the liver, egg for strength, pepper for the
nervous system. I don't know what Parmesan is for — perhaps just to remind me
that pleasure exists. 

(On his first night, my husband had takeout Indian. On his second, he made our
pork chops and burned the sauce. I know this because he sent me downhearted text
messages to that effect those nights, when we were both half-drunk on the bottle
of wine we had each drunk — we were more accustomed to sharing.) 

When the soup ran out almost a week later, I panicked. I'd found surprising
comfort in eating the same dish over and over. A square meal now seemed like
something from another lifetime. A week had also changed the prospect of
ordering takeout; it was now less the emergency Seconal borrowed from a worldly
friend and more the first step of a downward spiral ending who knows where. So
instead I wandered the lush produce aisles of an organic market. I lingered over
a gleaming, dark eggplant, attracted to its weightiness on a day when I felt I
might just float off the earth. But in the end a basket of emerald-hued okra
seduced me. I bought an enormous bag and took them "home." There was too much
for my pan. (I had one in the old apartment, our apartment, that would have
done.) So I sautéed them in two batches on high heat with a bit of olive oil and
red-pepper flakes, until the pods had softened a bit and browned in places but
retained their crispness and jewel-like color. And that was my entire
dinner. They were crunchy but voluptuous. The slight sliminess of the okra
captured the heat of the pepper, so it coated my tongue and burned. I ate them
like a dog scarfing down its favorite treat, until I felt sick. It was like
slamming my fingers in a drawer to get rid of a headache: painful, but not
ineffective. 

I lay on my sad red futon for a long time, digesting, while the girly music I
only ever listen to when I'm alone played tinnily on my laptop. In another
borough, my husband was doing the same, listening to Public Enemy or the
Replacements. I realized I had no idea what he'd eaten. 

My stomach rumbled, loud in the unfamiliar solitude. Maybe one day, I thought,
my husband and I would eat our meat and two sides together again. (As I write,
several months later, we are.) Though the pleasure was interrupted by a pinprick
of remorse, that night I wanted to be there, alone with my simple dinner and my
aching but quiet heart."""]
