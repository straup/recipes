stalks and leaves, cut them in smaller segments, and set aside. Scrub the bulbs,
peel them, and cut them in thickish slices.

Heat one tablespoon olive oil in a 6-quart heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium
heat. Add in the onions, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly to avoid
coloring. Add in the sliced bulbs and salt, and cook for five more minutes,
stirring regularly. Pour in 4 cups water or stock, bring to a simmer, cover, and
cook for 45 minutes, stirring every once in a while, until the beets are
tender. Half an hour into the cooking, add in the reserved stalks and leaves.

Purée the soup with an immersion blender. Season with freshly ground pepper,
taste, and adjust the seasoning -- it should be slightly undersalted, as the
anchovy-walnut paste will add some salt. Ladle the soup into bowls, and serve
with the anchovy and walnut paste on the side, to be stirred by the spoonful
into the soup."""]

  e:history (
     [a:content """I went to the market on Saturday morning, walking at a brisk
pace up the boulevard in the shy sunlight, stopping by the bank to deposit a
check (aren't you glad to know), and reaching the stands about a minute after
the greasy smells of potato pancakes had reached me -- how anyone can be tempted
by these is beyond me, but the guy who sells them seems to do quite well, so
perhaps I'm just not his target audience. 

Considering the mild and sunny weather we have been blessed with recently (with
the occasional shower, admittedly), I was fully expecting the market to have
shed its woolen cardigan for a nice short-sleeved shirt, perhaps linen or cotton
or a blend of the two, but I'm here to tell you that we ain't quite there
yet. The territory was still mostly occupied by root vegetables and citruses. 

Strawberries? Asparagus? Both spring scouts were present, but the asparagus was
outrageously priced, and the strawberries I tried were but a sketch of their
future self. It is always a delicate situation when you're kindly offered a
taste, and all your palate has to bring to the conversation is "bof" (a French
interjection that expresses indifference, lack of enthusiasm, or lack of
conviction), so you smile an apologetic smile and say, "Um, maybe next week?" 

Never one to lament for too long over a half-empty glass -- or at least I try --
I got myself some blood oranges and pears, a bunch of watercress, a couple of
kohlrabis, and a lush bouquet of beets, complete with stalks and leaves. After a
brief stop at the cheese stall (fresh butter, half a Reblochon, and an
outstanding Salers), I walked back home, already planning the soup I would cook
for lunch. 

And this is what I made, a simple tip-to-toe beet soup, with a quickly
whipped-up condiment of walnuts and anchovies -- both being among beets' best
friends -- to be stirred into our bowls at the time of serving, much like the
pistou in the Provencal soupe au pistou. The soup took on a very attractive
shade of deep purple -- so did my fingers and the kitchen cabinets beneath which
I pureed the soup -- and offered a pleasant mix of lightly sweet and earthy
flavors, spiked up by the pungency of the walnut-anchovy paste.""";
