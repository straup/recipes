  );

  e:directions (
    [a:content """1. Stir together the flour, salt, and instant yeast in a
4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). With a large metal spoon,
stir in the oil and the cold water until the flour is all absorbed (or mix on
low speed with the paddle attachment), If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip
one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a
dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the
bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few
times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the
dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you are using an
electric mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7
minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough
should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the
dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some
more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl,
dribble in a tea- spoon or two of cold water. The finished dough will be
springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky, and register 50 to 55F.

2. Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Prepare
a sheet pan by lining it with baking parchment and misting the parchment with
spray oil (or lightly oil the parchment). Using a metal dough scraper, cut the
dough into 6 equal pieces (or larger if you are comfortable shaping large
pizzas), You can dip the scraper into the water between cuts to keep the dough
from sticking to it, Sprinkle flour over the dough. Make sure your hands are dry
and then flour them. Lift each piece and gently round it into a ball. If the
dough sticks to your hands, dip your hands into the flour again. Transfer the
dough balls to the sheet pan, Mist the dough generously with spray oil and slip
the pan into a food-grade plastic bag. 

3. Put the pan into the refrigerator overnight to rest the dough, or keep for up
to 3 days. (Note: If you want to save some of the dough for future baking, you
can store the dough balls in a zippered freezer bag. Dip each dough ball into a
bowl that has a few tablespoons of oil in it, rolling the dough in the oil, and
then put each ball into a separate bag. You can place the bags into the freezer
for up to 3 months. Transfer them to the refrigerator the day before you plan to
make pizza.) 

4. On the day you plan to make the pizza, remove the desired number of dough
balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before making the pizza. Dust the counter
with flour, and then mist the counter with spray oil. Place the dough balls on
top of the floured counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with
flour. Gently press the dough into flat disks about 1/2 inch thick and 5 inches
in diameter. Sprinkle the dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and
cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Let rest
for 2 hours. 

5. At least 45 minutes before making the pizza, place a baking stone either on
the floor of the oven (for gas ovens), or on a rack in the lower third of the
oven. Preheat the oven as hot as possible, up to 800F (most home ovens will go
only to 500 to 550F, but some will go higher). If you do not have a baking
stone, you can use the back of a sheet pan, but do not preheat the pan. 

6. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or
cornmeal. Make the pizzas one at a time. Dip your hands, including the backs of
your hands and knuckles, in flour and lift I piece of dough by getting under it
with a pastry scraper. Very gently lay the dough across your fists and carefully
stretch it by bouncing the dough in a circular motion on your hands, carefully
giving it a little stretch with each bounce. If it begins to stick to your
hands, lay it down on the floured counter and reflour your hands, then continue
shaping it. Once the dough has expanded outward, move to a full toss as shown on
page 208. If you have trouble tossing the dough, or if the dough keeps springing
back, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax, and try
again. You can also resort to using a rolling pin, though this isn't as
effective as the toss method. 

7. When the dough is stretched out to your satisfaction (about 9 to 12 inches in
diameter for a 6-ounce piece of dough), lay it on the peel or pan, making sure
there is enough semolina flour or cornmeal to allow it to slide. Lightly top it
with sauce and then with your other top- pings, remembering that the best pizzas
are topped with a less-is-more philosophy. The American "kitchen sink" approach
is counterproductive, as it makes the crust more difficult to bake. A few,
usually no more than 3 or 4 toppings, including sauce and cheese is sufficient. 

8. Slide the topped pizza onto the stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan) and
close the door. Wait 2 minutes, then take a peek. If it needs to be rotated 180
degrees for even baking, do so. The pizza should take about 5 to 8 minutes to
bake. If the top gets done before the bottom, you will need to move the stone to
a lower self before the next round. if the bottom crisps before the cheese
caramelizes, then you will need to raise the stone for subsequent bakes. 

9. Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Wait 3 to 5
minutes before slicing and serving, to allow the cheese to set slightly."""]

    [a:content """Peter's recipe says the olive (or vegetable oil is
optional). I use it every time - always olive oil, not vegetable oil. I love the
moisture and suppleness it adds to the dough, and it makes your hands soft
too."""; a:author "[[http://www.101cookbooks.com/about/Heidi.html][Heidi]]"; ]
