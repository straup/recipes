Pizza dough

Ingredients
--

* 2 1/4 c `flour`
* 2 t sea `salt`
* 1 1/2 c `water`
* 1 t `yeast`
* 1 1/2 T `olive oil`

Directions
--

In a bowl, dissolve the yeast into the water. The water temperature should be 68 to 72
degrees (just slightly lukewarm). Add the flour and the sea salt to the yeast/water
mixture. Mix until combined and some gluten structure has developed. Add the olive oil
and knead until completely combined. If the dough is very wet, add a little more flour.

Turn the dough out onto a work surface covered with a sprinkling of flour, and knead
for 1 to 2 minutes, pushing the dough with the base of your palm, then folding the dough
over itself, turning it 90 degrees and pushing down again. Cover the dough with a damp
cloth, inverted bowl or plastic wrap and let rest for 3 to 5 minutes.

After the rest period, knead the dough another 30 seconds to 1 minute. At this point
the dough should be soft and smooth but firm.

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let the
dough rest. After 30 minutes, turn the dough (fold the dough over itself as if you
folding a letter). Let the dough ferment another 30 minutes and turn again. Rest for another
30 minutes.

Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and lightly round each into a ball. Let rest,
covered, for 10 to 20 minutes.
